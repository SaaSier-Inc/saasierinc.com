# SaaSier Inc. - Brand Guidelines

## 1. Brand Identity & Voice
SaaSier Inc represents innovation, professionalism, and forward-thinking technology. Our brand voice is confident, clear, and inclusive. We communicate complex technological concepts in an accessible, premium tone.

## 2. Color Palette
Our color palette reflects a modern, enterprise-grade aesthetic with high contrast and trustworthiness.

- **Primary Slate (Deep Dark Blue)**: `#0f172a`
  - *Usage*: Main text, backgrounds, footers, headers.
- **Dynamic Blue (Bright Accent)**: `#3b82f6`
  - *Usage*: Call-to-action buttons, links, active states, hover effects.
- **Secondary Slate**: `#64748b`
  - *Usage*: Secondary text, borders, subtle UI elements.
- **Crisp White / Light Grays**: `#ffffff`, `#f8fafc`, `#eff6ff`
  - *Usage*: Backgrounds, cards, text on dark backgrounds.

## 3. Typography
We utilize clean, highly legible fonts to establish a modern, trustworthy feel.

- **Headings (Playfair Display)**: Used for `h1`, `h2`, and primary section titles to give a premium, slightly editorial feel.
  - *Weights*: Semi-bold (600), Bold (700)
- **Body & UI (Inter)**: Used for all body copy, buttons, and navigation for maximum readability.
  - *Weights*: Light (300), Regular (400), Medium (500)

## 4. Logo Usage
- **Clear Space**: Always maintain a clear space around the logo equal to the height of the letter "S" in the logo.
- **Minimum Size**: Do not reproduce the logo smaller than 30px in height to ensure legibility.
- **Do Not**: Stretch, distort, or change the colors of the logo. Do not place the dark logo on dark backgrounds without sufficient contrast.

## 5. Visual Language (Glassmorphism)
Our primary visual language includes "Glassmorphism" — elements that appear frosted and slightly transparent over a background.
- UI Cards should use semi-transparent white backgrounds (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9)`) with a subtle backdrop filter (`blur(16px)`).
- Hover states should include a soft lift (`translateY`) and a bright, subtle glow (`box-shadow: 0 0 24px rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.4)`).
